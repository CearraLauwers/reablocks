# Drawer
The Drawer component provides a hidden or off-canvas panel that can slide in or out from the edge of the screen,
offering additional navigation or content without obstructing the main interface. One common use case is when user
is analysing a list of entries from a table and they quickly wants to see details for some entries.

## Example

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={DrawerStories.Simple} />
### Drawer as bottom sheet
<Canvas of={DrawerStories.BottomSheet} />

## Theme
This component uses the following default theme:

<ThemeRender theme={darkDrawerTheme} />
