# Redact
The "Redact" component is a simple and intuitive way to redact info in scenarios where you need to hide confidential information, such as passwords, personal details, or any other sensitive text.
It uses [coverup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/coverup).
## Examples
### Basic Usage
To redact text, simply pass the sensitive string you wish to hide to the value prop of the Redact component. 
The component obscures the text, showing only a predefined number of characters as a placeholder:
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={RedactStories.Basic} />

## API
The Redact component is highly customizable through the following properties:
<ArgTypes of={Redact} />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Toggle Simplicity:** Make toggling the visibility of redacted information simple and intuitive, using icons or textual cues that clearly indicate the action.
- **Sensitive Information Awareness:** Educate users about the sensitivity of the information being redacted, potentially through tooltips or help icons, to foster understanding and cautious interaction.
