# Pager
The Pager component facilitates navigation through pages of data, 
allowing users to easily switch between different subsets of data. 
It supports customization of navigation indicators (arrows) and provides various display modes to tailor how pagination information is presented.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
#### Simple Pager with Page Numbers
In this example, the pager displays page numbers, 
allowing users to navigate through pages based on a specific range of items:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={PagerStories.ShowPages} />

#### Displaying Range of Items
To show the current range of items (e.g., "1-10 of 100 items"), 
you can set the displayMode to "items":
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={PagerStories.ShowItems} />

#### Comprehensive Pagination Information
For a more detailed view, including both page numbers and the items range, set `displayMode` to "all":
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={PagerStories.ShowAll} />

## API
The Pager component offers a range of properties for customization and flexibility:
<ArgTypes of={Pager} />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Predictable Navigation:** Design pager controls to be predictable and consistent, with clear indications of current page and total number of pages, aiding in orientation within the dataset.
- **Responsive Adaptation:** Ensure pager controls adapt responsively to different screen sizes, maintaining usability and accessibility on mobile devices.
