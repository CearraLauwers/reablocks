# Sort
The "Sort" component is a straightforward, user-friendly tool designed for toggling the sort direction of data within your application.
 Ideal for data tables or lists that require sorting capabilities, it provides visual indicators for the current sort direction and allows users to change the sort order with a simple click.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
To use the Sort component, manage the sort direction state in your component or page and pass it along with a callback function to handle changes in sort direction. 
This example demonstrates how to integrate the Sort component with ascending ('asc') and descending ('desc') sort directions:
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={SortStories.Simple} />

## API
Customize the Sort component using the following properties:
<ArgTypes of={Sort} />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Sort Confirmation:** Provide immediate visual feedback when a sort order is applied, such as highlighting the active sort column or displaying a sorted icon, reinforcing the user's action.
