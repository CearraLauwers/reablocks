# Infinity List
A list that can be paged until the end of the list is reached. The list
assumes that all data is loaded at once and is not paged by the server.
It also handles fuzzy pagination, for example if there are 7 items and
the page size is 5, it will just show the 7 items rather than have
a button to show 2 more.

You can use the component directly like in the example below or via
the hook API.

## Example

### Component
<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-data-infinitylist--simple" />
</Canvas>

### Hook API
<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-data-infinitylist--hook" />
</Canvas>

## API
<ArgsTable of={InfinityList} />
