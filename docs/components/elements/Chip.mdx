# Chip
The "Chip" component is a versatile UI element commonly used for displaying tags, labels, statuses, or categories. It's highly customizable, enabling the use of different types, colors, sizes, and even adornments like icons. 
Chips can be interactive, allowing for selection or removal, making them suitable for various applications from filtering content to showing user selections.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
The Chip component supports several style variants such as "filled" and "outline". 
This allows for clear differentiation between different chip types based on their purpose or context within the UI:
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={ChipStories.Variants} />

### Advanced Customization
#### Colors and Sizes
Chips can be customized further in terms of color and size, providing flexibility to match them with the application's design theme:
<Canvas of={ChipStories.Colors} />
<Canvas of={ChipStories.Sizes} />

#### Icon Adornment
Adding icons to chips enhances visual communication and can indicate additional functionalities like deletion or selection:
<Canvas of={ChipStories.Adornment} />

#### Selectable Chips
Chips can be made selectable, allowing users to choose one or more options from a set:
<Canvas of={ChipStories.Selectable} />

## Theme Customization
The Chip component comes with a default theme, which can be customized according to your application's design requirements:

<ThemeRender theme={darkChipTheme} />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](?path=/docs/docs-theme-getting-started--docs).

## API
Customize the Chip component using the following properties:
<ArgTypes of={Chip} />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Dynamic Interaction:** For chips representing dynamic content (like filters), provide immediate visual feedback when the state changes (e.g., through animation) to reflect the action's impact.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Beyond color, utilize shapes or icons within chips to communicate status or category for those with color vision deficiencies.
