# Command Palette
The Command Palette enables efficient user interaction by consolidating application commands in a searchable, centralized interface.
It's akin to a spotlight search, providing immediate access to features, documents, settings, or actions directly from the keyboard.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
This example showcases a basic Command Palette setup with sections for "Recently Used" commands and "Suggestions":
<Canvas of={Stories.Simple}/>

## Theme Customization
The default theme for the Command Palette is designed for clarity and ease of use,
but can be customized to match your application's design language:

<ThemeRender theme={commandPaletteTheme} />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](?path=/docs/docs-theme-getting-started--docs).

## API
Customize the Command Palette through the following properties:
<ArgTypes of={CommandPalette} />

## Design and Usability Tips
- **Intuitive Access:** Ensure the Command Palette is easily accessible through a well-known keyboard shortcut (e.g., Cmd/Ctrl + P), making it discoverable and convenient.
- **Clear Categorization:** Organize commands into clear categories or sections to help users quickly find what they need.
