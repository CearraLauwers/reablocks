# AvatarGroup
The "AvatarGroup" component is designed to efficiently display a collection of user avatars, making it ideal for showcasing team members, participant lists, or any group of users. 
It smartly handles large numbers of avatars by showing a set maximum number on the screen, with an additional indicator for the number of hidden avatars.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
The AvatarGroup component arranges multiple Avatar components together, indicating excess avatars when surpassing the specified maximum size:
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={AvatarGroupStories.Basic} />

## Theme Customization
AvatarGroup supports theming to ensure its appearance aligns with the overall design of your application. 
The default theme settings include:

<ThemeRender theme={darkAvatarGroupTheme} />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](?path=/docs/docs-theme-getting-started--docs).

## API
Customization options available through the AvatarGroup component's properties:
<ArgTypes of={AvatarGroup} />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Expandable Details:** Provide a mechanism (e.g., tooltip or modal) to view all avatars in a group on click or hover, ensuring users can access every member's profile without cluttering the UI.
- **Customizable Views:** Allow users to customize the visibility and ordering of avatars in a group, accommodating personal preferences and improving the experience.
