# Button

The "Button" component is a fundamental UI element designed for interactions, offering a variety of styles, sizes, and colors to accommodate different use cases within an application. 
Additionally, a "ButtonGroup" is provided to layout multiple buttons in a cohesive unit, enhancing the visual consistency and usability of grouped actions.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
The Button component supports several variants including "filled", "outline", and "text", allowing for flexibility in design and application:
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={ButtonStories.Variants} />

### Advanced Customization
#### Sizes and Colors
Buttons can be customized further with size and color variations, providing a wide range of styling options to match your UI design:
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Sizes} />

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Colors} />

#### Buttons with Icon
Incorporating icons with text can enhance button functionality and user understanding:
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.WithIcon} />
#### Group of Buttons
The ButtonGroup component allows for organizing multiple buttons together, which is particularly useful for related actions:
<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.Colors} />

## Theme Customization
The Button component comes with a default theme that can be customized for consistency with your application's design language:

<ThemeRender theme={darkButtonTheme} />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](?path=/docs/docs-theme-getting-started--docs).

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Focus Indicators:** Maintain visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation, aiding in accessibility and indicating the current interactive element to users.
- **Efficient Space Use:** Optimize button sizes and padding to use space efficiently while ensuring touch targets meet accessibility standards (minimum 44x44 pixels).
