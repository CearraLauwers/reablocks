# Inline Input
The Inline Input component is tailored for inline editing scenarios, offering a fluid and responsive input field that expands in response to user input. 
This component is ideally suited for applications requiring seamless inline text modifications without the cumbersome overhead of traditional form inputs.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
This example demonstrates the Inline Input in action, providing a user-friendly editing experience within a bordered container. 
The input field automatically adjusts its size as the user types, accommodating the entered text while maintaining a compact UI footprint:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={InlineInputStories.Basic} />

## API
Configure the Inline Input component to fit your specific inline editing needs with these properties:
<ArgTypes of={InlineInput} />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Responsive Behavior:** Test the Inline Input component across various device sizes and screen resolutions to guarantee a consistent and usable experience. 
Inline editing elements should remain functional and visually coherent even on smaller screens, where space is at a premium.
