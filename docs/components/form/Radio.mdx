# Radio

Radio elements play a crucial role in UI/UX design by facilitating exclusive selection among a set of options.
This ensures that users can choose only one item from a list, streamlining clear decision-making processes and providing enhanced control.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
Illustrates a singular Radio button allowing users to make a choice with a simple click:
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={RadioStories.Simple} />

### Advanced Customization
#### Size Variations
Showcases Radio buttons in different sizes: small, medium, and large, accommodating various design needs and enhancing UI flexibility:
<Canvas of={RadioStories.Sizes} />

#### Disabled state
Demonstrates a Radio button in a disabled state, indicating non-interactive periods or conditions within the user interface:
<Canvas of={RadioStories.Disabled} />

#### Group of Radio Buttons with Single Form Control
A set of Radio buttons grouped together, allowing users to select one option from multiple choices, with a single selected value reflected in the application:
<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.Simple} />

## Theme Customization
The Radio component adheres to the following default theme, ensuring aesthetic consistency and visual appeal:

<ThemeRender theme={radioTheme} />

## API

### Radio
<ArgTypes of={Radio} />

### RadioGroup
<ArgTypes of={RadioGroup} />
