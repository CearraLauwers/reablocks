# Checkbox
The Checkbox component is an essential element in UI/UX design, allowing users to make selections among a set of options. 
It enhances user control by enabling or disabling specific choices, thereby facilitating interactive and dynamic forms, settings, and controls within applications.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
This basic example showcases a checkbox that users can click to enable or disable an option. It demonstrates the component's primary functionality - toggling between checked and unchecked states:
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={CheckboxStories.Simple} />

### Advanced Customization
#### Size Variations
Customize the size of the Checkbox to match the design requirements of your application, offering variations like small, medium, and large for better visual integration and user experience:
<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Sizes} />

### State Variations
Implement checkboxes with additional states such as disabled for non-interactive scenarios and intermediate for partially selected groups or indeterminate states:
<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.States} />

## Theme Customization
The Checkbox component features a default theme that can be customized to align with your application's aesthetics. Here's an overview of the theme structure:

<ThemeRender theme={darkCheckboxTheme} />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](?path=/docs/docs-theme-getting-started--docs).

## API
Fine-tune the Checkbox component's functionality and style with a wide array of configurable properties:
<ArgTypes of={Checkbox} />

## Design and Usability Tips
- **Visual Clarity:** Ensure checkboxes are large enough to be easily tapped on touch devices, adhering to accessible design principles. A minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels is recommended. This enhances usability across various devices, particularly for users with motor impairments.
- **Label Legibility:** Accompany every checkbox with a clear and concise label. Labels should be directly clickable to toggle the checkbox state, reducing the precision required for interaction and thus improving the overall user experience.
