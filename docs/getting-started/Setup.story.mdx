# Setup

## Installing
You can install reablocks with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reablocks) or Yarn.

- NPM: `npm install reablocks --save`
- YARN: `yarn add reablocks`

## Getting Started
Reablocks aims to be design system agnostic. Out of the box, Reablocks includes a
lightweight design token system, however, that is optional.

Not all of the components require design tokens, but the more visual-based ones do.
If a component requires a design token, it will be called out in the documentation
so that developers are aware.

As a result, there are two different approaches for setting up Reablocks:

- Design Token Provider
- CSS Variables

### Design Token Provider
The design token provider gives you a standard system to define spacing, colors,
and themes. It comes with a React provider and hook so you can get started
with Reablocks easily and in a standard way.

You don't have to use this provider; one reason is if you already
have a design system in place and just want to use pieces of Reablocks.

To get started with the design tokens provider, you can simply import
it at the top of your application.

```tsx
import { DesignTokensProvider, lightTheme } from 'reablocks';

export const App = () => (
  <>
    <DesignTokensProvider theme={lightTheme}>
      Your Application Code
    </DesignTokensProvider>
  </>
);
```

To learn more about the design tokens, visit the documentation
specific for the design tokens.

### CSS Variables
If you are using the CSS variables approach, simply
define each design token ( called out in each component documentation )
to the body element like:

```css
body {
  --divider-bg: #ccc;
  --divider-spacing: 25px;
}
```
