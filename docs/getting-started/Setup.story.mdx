# Setup

## Installing
You can install reablocks with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reablocks) or Yarn.

- NPM: `npm install reablocks --save`
- YARN: `yarn add reablocks`

## Getting Started
reablocks aims to be design system agnostic. Out of the box, reablocks
includes a light weight design token system, however, that is optional.

Not all of the components require design tokens but the more visual
based ones do. If a component requires a design token, it will be called
out in the documentation so that developers are aware.

As a result, there are 2 different approaches for setting up reablocks:

- Design Token Provider
- CSS Variables

### Design Token Provider
The design token provider gives you a standard system to define
spacing, colors and themes. It comes with a React provider and hook
so you can get started with reablocks really easily in a standard way.

You don't have to use this provider, one reason is if you already have
a design system in place and just want to use pieces of reablocks.

To get started with the design tokens provider, you can simply import
it at the top of your application and now you

```tsx
import { DesignTokensProvider, lightTheme } from 'reablocks';

export const App = () => (
  <>
    <DesignTokensProvider theme={lightTheme}>
      Your Application Code
    </DesignTokensProvider>
  </>
);
```

To learn more about the design tokens, visit the documentation
specific for the design tokens.

### CSS Variables
If you are using the CSS variables approach, simply
define each design token ( called out in each component documentation )
to the body element like:

```css
body {
  --divider-bg: #ccc;
  --divider-spacing: 25px;
}
```
