# Philosophy
When you first see this library, one of the first questions you might
ask yourself when you take a look at this library is why another
component library; don't we have enough? Its true, there are a LOT
of component libraries out there such as MUI, AntD, Tailwind and the
list continues. These libraries are very mature and can help you build
a great looking application without too much work, however, they come
with a number of drawbacks. Let's take a look at those real quick.

## Design Style Opinions
Libraries such as MUI look great out of the box,
but they are extremely opinionated about their design philosphy and thats OK.
Those design philosphies can help you build a nice looking application very
quickly without the need for a designer.

The problem is if you want a more customized
design than say just changing some colors, it becomes more of a challenge and the
benefits begin to dwindle. Most all offer customization ability but those customizations
like disabling the ripple of a material button come at a cost:

- Download bloat (ripples/animations are hard)
- Internal breaking changes (once start customizing internal styles which almost always happens)
- Increased complexity with overrides

reablocks is designed to not have a design out of the box. We plan to offer
themes and provide lots of examples of how to make them beautiful but not having
a design is our priority. This let's you avoid all the nasty overrides and
focus on building the product your team needs.

## CSS-IN-JS
When CSS-IN-JS first came out, it was game changer. It allowed developers the
ability to write runtime CSS which allowed us to break away from the build time
variables we had in LESS/SASS. The ability to do calculations on sizes, dynamically
change colors for dark themes and provide a nice typesafe API.

CSS has matured so much since then, literally almost everything I listed above
and more can be done with native CSS now. By using the native CSS you also
get some other advantages:

- Better performance
- Standard language for styling not matter the project
- Seperation of concerns ( styles and code belong in different places )

To this day, almost every React based component library still uses css-in-js.
There are many die hard css-in-js fans out there that could debate this all day
long, its almost like debating react vs angular vs vue though.

reablocks is designed to use native CSS features such as CSS variables. Out of the box,
we provide helpers such as our design tokens provider to help you standardize and provide
a convientant way to define those variables but you don't have to use it and under the hood
its just printing out standard CSS.

The one drawback to this approach is if you have to support really old browsers,
then this won't work. If thats the case, this library isn't for you. Once you don't
have to support those, please give us a look again though!

## Documentation
Almost all of the libraries I mentioned have great documentation and examples. The
challenge begins once you start customizing the components. Some of them let you
change the colors inline but if you start adding custom CSS styles and such all
that goes out the window. Outside of that, maintaining legacy documentation
for open-source developers is difficult at each version point.

Often times developers will take the examples from the libraries website
and build out Storybook stories for them so you can have the examples
customized to your usage.

Rather than build a fancy documentation site, reablock's documentation is all
built inside Storybook. By doing this, all the documentation is in easy to consume
and standard format that any consumer can import into their Storybook. We've even
built Storybook story helpers and specific documentation on how to set it up in
your application.

reablocks is the first component library to take a Storybook-first. This is a
core principle of ours so we are dedicated to making this as smooth as possible.

## Agnostic Framework Pitfalls
A recent trend in the ui component libraries is to make vanilla Javascript
components and then create wrappers for them. As a open-source developer, I understand
the reasoning, however, it comes with sacrafices.

- Developers are not able to take advantage of native capabilities
and instead monkey patch to support the various frameworks. This can result
in oddities due to multiple scripts accessing the DOM not in sync with each other.
- The APIs have to make sacrafices, for example it becomes more difficult to
design APIs that take advantage of some of the awesome React features like JSX inputs.
- The documentation and examples suffer because its so much to maintain.
- Download bloat is increased because you have to handle things that React just does
manually resulting in a larger download size.

reablocks is dedicated to React and we are going to be focusing on it exclusively.

## Animations
Most of the libraries have their own animation frameworks they use internally
( or don't even do animations natively ). Animations are not just important for
user experience but can provide valuable experiences to see how data changes
over time.

The challenge begins when you need to syncronize animations between
all the various components. For example, you have a drawer component and when it
opens you want to animate in the child components. Usually developers handle this
by doing `setTimeout` for the duration the drawer takes to open which is bad for a
few reasons.

- Its brittle since the timing is based on the ideal system that
can animate at that speed
- This assumes the animations are all linear, good animations
are spring based since they feel more natural

reablocks ( and all the reaviz projects for that matter ) are all built
on framer-motion. Framer motion is amazing, it performs spring ( and linear if you want )
based animations that happen at 60 FPS and can syncronize between desperate
components. Its a big bet, but framer-motion has been out for a while
( previously named react-pose and based on popmotion ) and is supported by
Framer so as far as bets are concerned in technology, its about as good one
as you can make.

## Enterprise-focused
One unique attribute of this library is that we aren't trying to make a library
that is everything to everyone. We are focusing on only on enterprise web applications
and more specifically data intensive applications. You won't find any hero banners
or similar components, instead components like displaying large numbers, formatting
data sizes and so on.

## Wrap up
reablocks is built by industry leading proffesionals and the lead developer
[Austin McDaniel](https://github.com/amcdnl) was a former Angular Material team member.
The team has built more than half a dozen component libraries and the project
is supported by [Good Code](https://goodcode.us).

We hope you enjoy our hard work, please share with others and let's make
the web a better place.
