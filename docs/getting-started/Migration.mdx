# Migration

## Migrating from 5.x to 6.x
In 6.x, we introduced a new way to theme reablocks using
Tailwind. This means that you can now use the full power of
Tailwind to style your blocks and components. This also means
that the old themeing approach using CSS variables is deprecated.

To get started with the transition to 6.x, let's follow the steps below:

```shell
TODO install tailwind
```
