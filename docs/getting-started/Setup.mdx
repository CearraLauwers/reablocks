# Setup

## Installing
You can install reablocks with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reablocks) or Yarn.

- NPM: `npm install reablocks --save`
- YARN: `yarn add reablocks`

## Getting Started
Reablocks aims to be design system agnostic. Out of the box, Reablocks includes a
lightweight design token system, however, that is optional.

Not all of the components require design tokens, but the more visual-based ones do.
If a component requires a design token, it will be called out in the documentation
so that developers are aware.

As a result, there are two different approaches for setting up Reablocks:

- Design Token Provider
- CSS Variables

### Design Token Provider
The design token provider gives you a standard system to define spacing, colors,
and themes. It comes with a React provider and hook so you can get started
with Reablocks easily and in a standard way.

You don't have to use this provider; one reason is if you already
have a design system in place and just want to use pieces of Reablocks.

To get started with the design tokens provider, you can simply import
it at the top of your application.

```tsx
import { DesignTokensProvider, lightTheme } from 'reablocks';

export const App = () => (
  <>
    <DesignTokensProvider theme={lightTheme}>
      Your Application Code
    </DesignTokensProvider>
  </>
);
```

To learn more about the design tokens, visit the documentation
specific for the design tokens.

### CSS Variables
If you are using the CSS variables approach, simply
define each design token ( called out in each component documentation )
to the body element like:

```css
body {
  --divider-bg: #ccc;
  --divider-spacing: 25px;
}
```

## Developing

If you want to run the project locally, its really easy!

The project uses Storybook for its demos and development
environment. To run it locally:

- Clone repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Once started the browser will open to the storybook url.
From here you can tweak components and see them build
and reload in real time.

We use Rollup to build and package for distribution.
You can run this by doing `npm run build` and it will
create a `dist` folder with the type definitions, bundled
javascript and css files.
