# Setup
This section will guide you through the initial steps required to integrate Tailwind CSS into your project. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that can be customized to fit the design needs of your project. Follow these instructions to ensure a smooth setup.
&nbsp;
### Installing Tailwind CSS
**1.** Open your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and run the following command:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

**2.** Still in the terminal, initialize Tailwind CSS by running:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    './node_modules/reablocks/**/*.{js}'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
**Result:** This command creates a 'tailwind.config.js' and a 'postcss.config.js' file in your project root.

&nbsp;

**3.** After installing Tailwind CSS, you need to inject its styles into your project. Do this by adding Tailwind's directives to your main CSS file. These directives include `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;`. Here's how:
-  Open or create your main CSS file. This file is typically located at `src/index.css` or `src/styles.css`.
-  Add the following Tailwind directives at the top of your CSS file:


```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
**Result:** These directives inject Tailwind's base styles, component classes, and utility classes into your stylesheet, making them available throughout your project.

### Install Reablocks

Reablocks is a set of reusable blocks designed to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. You can install Reablocks using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reablocks) or Yarn, depending on your project setup:
- **Using NPM:**

```bash
npm install reablocks --save
```
- **Using Yarn:**

```bash
yarn add reablocks
```

## Developing

If you want to run the project locally, its really easy!

The project uses Storybook for its demos and development environment. To run it locally:

- **Clone the repository.**
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:reaviz/reablocks.git
```
- **Install dependencies.**
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
- **Start Storybook.**
Once the installation is complete, start the Storybook development server:

```bash
npm start
```

**Result:** This command runs Storybook locally and opens it in your default web browser, typically at `http://localhost:6006.` You can now view your components, experiment with their properties, and see changes in real-time.

### Building for Distribution with Rollup
Our project uses Rollup for bundling and preparing the package for distribution. To build the project, simply run:

```bash
npm run build
```
**Result:** This command generates a `dist` folder containing the bundled JavaScript, CSS files, and type definitions, ready for deployment or distribution.
