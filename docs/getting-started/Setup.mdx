# Setup

## Installing

### Install Tailwind
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Next you will need to configure a `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of your project.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    'node_modules/reablocks/**/*.js'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Lastly setup the Tailwind directives inside your main css file.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Install Reablocks
You can install reablocks with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reablocks) or Yarn.

```bash
npm install reablocks --save
```

## Developing

If you want to run the project locally, its really easy!

The project uses Storybook for its demos and development
environment. To run it locally:

- Clone repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Once started the browser will open to the storybook url.
From here you can tweak components and see them build
and reload in real time.

We use Rollup to build and package for distribution.
You can run this by doing `npm run build` and it will
create a `dist` folder with the type definitions, bundled
javascript and css files.
