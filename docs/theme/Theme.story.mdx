# Getting Started
A provider for design tokens in your application. It has no opinions about
the UI libraries you use, and it's agnostic to the design system you use.

It also provides Storybook blocks for you to use in your storybook.

## Example

Initalize it in the root of your application like:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'reablocks';

export const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider value={myTheme}>
    <YourComponents />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

Later on you can use the hook to get the design tokens:

```tsx
import { useTheme } from 'reablocks';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  //-> All tokens available
  const tokens = useTheme();
};
```

You can also use it via CSS variables like:

```css
.body {
  color: var(--body-color);
}
```
