# Getting Started
Reablocks theming is seamlessly integrated into the Tailwind CSS configuration, allowing for a highly customizable design system.
This approach leverages Tailwind's utility-first CSS to offer you an extensive range of design tokens such as colors, border radii, shadows, and font sizes.
In addition, Reablocks provides a set of pre-defined [Storybook blocks](?path=/docs/docs-theme-blocks--docs) that can be used to quickly build and customize your UI components in a Storybook environment.

### Integrating Reablocks Theme in Your Application
To get started with Reablocks theming, you first need to incorporate the `ThemeProvider` into the root of your application.
This provider applies the selected theme across all your components, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

- **Basic Theme Example**

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider, darkTheme } from 'reablocks';

export const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}>
    <YourComponents />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```
**Result:** In this example, the `darkTheme` from Reablocks is applied to your application.
Simply wrap your component hierarchy with the `ThemeProvider`, and the theme is automatically applied.

### Create a reusable component with a custom theme
You can also pass theme={} directly to any component, which will override the theme for that component, but not its children.
This is useful if you want to create a reusable component with a custom theme.

```tsx
import { darkTooltipTheme, TooltipTheme, extendComponentTheme } from 'reablocks';

export const CustomTheme = () => {
  const customTheme = extendComponentTheme<TooltipTheme>(darkTooltipTheme, {
    base: 'rounded bg-green-800 text-white font-bold p-3 text-base'
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <Tooltip theme={customTheme} content="Hi there">Hover me</Tooltip>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Extending the Reablocks Theme
Reablocks allows you to extend its themes to customize according to your design requirements.
You can modify existing styles or add new ones to fit your application's unique design language.

- **Customizing Theme Example**

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider, darkTheme, extendTheme, PartialReablocksTheme } from 'reablocks';

export const App = () => (
  const customTheme: PartialReablocksTheme = {
    components: {
      button: {
        base: 'bg-lime-600 text-gray-300',
        variants: {
          filled: 'bg-lime-600 hover:bg-lime-700',
          outline: 'bg-transparent border-lime-600 border',
          text: 'bg-transparent border-0'
        },
        sizes: {
          small: 'p-2',
          medium: 'p-3',
          large: 'p-4'
        }
      }
    }
  };

  <ThemeProvider theme={extendTheme(darkTheme, customTheme)}>
    <YourComponents />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```
**Result:** This example demonstrates how to create a `customTheme` that extends the `darkTheme`.
By using the `extendTheme` function, you can merge your customizations with the base theme, resulting in a coherent design system that still benefits from Reablocks' foundation.

### Defining Custom Tokens with TailwindCSS
Reablocks themes can further leverage TailwindCSS's configuration to define custom design tokens.
This allows for an even deeper level of customization, integrating seamlessly with your TailwindCSS setup.

- **TailwindCSS Configuration Example**

```ts
import { type Config } from 'tailwindcss';
import colors from 'tailwindcss/colors';

const config: Config = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    'node_modules/reablocks/**/*.js'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          50: '#f3f4f6',
          100: '#e7e9ed',
          200: '#c3c8d3',
          300: '#9fa6b9',
          400: '#565f86',
          500: '#0d1733',
          600: '#0c1530',
          700: '#0a1228',
          800: '#080f20',
          900: '#060c19',
        },
        secondary: colors.slate,
      }
    },
  },
};

export default config;

```
**Result:** In this configuration, we extend the default TailwindCSS theme to include custom colors for primary and secondary palettes.
The `extend` property allows you to add to the existing design tokens without overriding them, ensuring you can update and maintain your theme easily.
